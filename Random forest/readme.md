For the classification task, I embarked on a project aimed at automating feature engineering and model training using the 'tips' dataset sourced from seaborn. Leveraging a pipeline approach, I engineered features and trained models using various algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. The pipeline also incorporated hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
On the other hand, the regression task tackled a problem statement involving a dataset containing information about used cars sold on cardehko.com in India, alongside important features of these cars. The objective was to predict the price of a car based on its features, with the potential application of providing price suggestions to new sellers based on market conditions. To address this task, I conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, and feature encoding for categorical columns. Subsequently, I employed regression models such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the performance of these models.
